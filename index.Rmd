### Lecture Slides

- [lecture 1](https://weiakanedeng.github.io/STA248_UT2018Summer/lec1.pdf) and rmarkdown document to generate the slides can be found [here](https://weiakanedeng.github.io/STA248_UT2018Summer/lec1.Rmd) for you to look at the code chunks. 

To practice what you learnt in Lecture 1, you can explore the car [dataset](https://weiakanedeng.github.io/STA248_UT2018Summer/Cars93.csv) (data description [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Cars93.html)). For each variable, generate what you think is the best graphical and numerical summaries. You should be able to defend your choice using the material from the lecture slides.
